The Ludlow story comes from "The Mansion of Mad Professor Ludlow" by James M. Ward
and published in the October 1980 edition of Dragon Magazine.

The ludlowScript.xml, images, and sounds in this directory attempt to define the mansion described in the
story module. This content is completely decoupled from the source code. The Adventure code can be used to produce
any sort of story, but this particular story that I recall from my childhood seemed like a nice example to use.
  The scanned story pages are included in pdf form in the hope that someone can complete the script
with images and sound files. Since I am not trying to profit from this use, and the use is purley education/research I
believe this is fair use, but I'm no lawyer.
