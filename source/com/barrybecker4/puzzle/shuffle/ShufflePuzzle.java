/**
 * Given a deck of nCards unique cards, cut the deck iCut cards from top and perform a perfect shuffle.
 * A perfect shuffle begins by putting down the bottom card from the top portion of the deck followed by the bottom card
 * from the bottom portion of the deck followed by the next card from the top portion, etc., alternating cards
 * until one portion is used up. The remaining cards go on top. The problem is to find the number of
 * perfect shuffles required to return the deck to its original order. Your function should be declared as:
 *
 *    static long shuffles(int nCards, int iCut);
 *
 * Find the result for shuffles(1002, 101)
